## Project Overview

This project involved the development of an interactive Retail Store Sales Dashboard using Power BI. The primary goal was to provide key stakeholders with a comprehensive and intuitive view of sales performance, enabling data-driven decision-making. The dashboard leverages data cleaning techniques in Power Query, robust data modeling and analysis with DAX, and engaging visualizations in Power BI.

## Business Questions

This dashboard aims to answer critical business questions related to retail sales, including:

* What are the total revenue, quantity sold, and number of transactions over time?
* How does total revenue trend month-over-month?
* Which products are the top performers in terms of sales?
* What is the revenue distribution across different sales channels (online vs. in-store)?
* What are the preferred payment methods used by customers?
* How do sales metrics vary by year?
* What is the daily sales performance and category-wise sales breakdown?

## Objectives & Deliverables

The main objectives of this project were:

* To clean and transform raw sales data using Power Query for optimal analysis.
* To create a robust data model in Power BI, establishing necessary relationships between tables.
* To develop insightful DAX measures to calculate key performance indicators (KPIs) such as total revenue, quantity sold, and total transactions.
* To design and implement an interactive Power BI dashboard that visually represents sales trends, product performance, channel distribution, and payment method preferences.
* To provide actionable insights and recommendations based on the data analysis to improve sales strategies.

## Data Source

The data used for this dashboard typically includes transactional sales records. While the specific source isn't detailed, it would generally contain information such as:

* **Order Date:** Date of the transaction.
* **Product ID/Name:** Identifier and name of the product sold.
* **Quantity:** Number of units sold.
* **Price:** Unit price of the product.
* **Revenue:** Total sales amount for the transaction.
* **Location/Sales Channel:** (e.g., In-store, Online).
* **Payment Method:** (e.g., Cash, Credit Card, Digital Wallet).
* **Category:** Product category.

## Data Cleaning (Power Query)

Power Query was extensively used to clean and transform the raw data, ensuring its quality and suitability for analysis. Key data cleaning steps likely included:

* **Handling Missing Values:** Identifying and addressing any missing data points.
* **Data Type Conversion:** Ensuring columns have the correct data types (e.g., dates, numbers, text).
* **Removing Duplicates:** Eliminating any duplicate records to maintain data integrity.
* **Formatting:** Standardizing text fields and ensuring consistent formatting.
* **Creating Custom Columns:** Potentially deriving new columns relevant for analysis (e.g., 'Year', 'Month Name' from a date column).
* **Merging/Appending Queries:** Combining data from different sources or tables if necessary.

## Data Analysis (DAX)

DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) was crucial for creating powerful measures and calculated columns that drive the insights on the dashboard. Key DAX measures implemented likely include:

* **Total Revenue:** `CALCULATE(SUM(Sales[Revenue]))`
* **Quantity Sold:** `CALCULATE(SUM(Sales[Quantity]))`
* **Total Transactions:** `DISTINCTCOUNT(Sales[TransactionID])` (assuming a Transaction ID column)
* **Revenue by Month/Year:** Measures leveraging time intelligence functions.

## Data Visualization (Power BI)

The dashboard was designed in Power BI with a focus on clarity, interactivity, and delivering key insights at a glance. Visualizations include:

* **KPI Cards:** Displaying `Total Revenue`, `Quantity Sold`, and `Total Transactions` for immediate performance overview.
* **Area/ Line Chart: Total Revenue by Month:** Visualizing the monthly sales trend, highlighting seasonal fluctuations.
* **Bar Chart: Top Performing Products:** Identifying the products contributing most to revenue.
* **Column Chart: Revenue by Location:** Comparing online vs. in-store sales performance.
* **Donut Chart: Revenue by Payment Method:** Showing the proportion of revenue generated by different payment types.
* **Slicers:** Interactive filters for `Year`, `Location`, `Days`, and `Category`, allowing users to drill down into specific data segments.

## Insights

Based on the dashboard visualizations, several key insights can be drawn:

* **Monthly Revenue Fluctuations:** The "Total Revenue by Month" chart clearly shows peaks and troughs in sales throughout the year, with a significant drop in February and a general upward trend towards the end of the year.
* **Top Product Performance:** Products like 'BUT', 'EHE', and 'BEV' are consistently among the top revenue generators, indicating strong customer demand for these items.
* **Channel Dominance:** Online sales significantly outperform in-store sales, suggesting a strong digital presence and customer preference for online shopping.
* **Payment Method Preferences:** Credit Card and Cash are almost equally preferred payment methods, with Digital Wallet having a slightly lower share.
* **Yearly Trends:** The year slicer allows for quick comparison of performance across different years.

## Recommendations

Based on the insights, here are some recommendations for the retail store:

* **Address Seasonal Dips:** Investigate the reasons for the sharp drop in revenue in February and strategize promotions or marketing campaigns to counteract this trend in future years.
* **Focus on Top Products:** Leverage the success of top-performing products ('BUT', 'EHE', 'BEV') by ensuring adequate stock, promoting them further, or analyzing their success to apply strategies to other products.
* **Optimize Online Channel:** Given the strong online performance, continue investing in e-commerce strategies, user experience improvements, and digital marketing to further boost online sales.
* **Payment Method Optimization:** While Credit Card and Cash are dominant, consider promoting digital wallet options through incentives to diversify payment channels and cater to evolving customer preferences.
* **Targeted Marketing:** Use the insights from category and location filters to create more targeted marketing campaigns and product offerings.


## Potential future enhancements for this dashboard include:

* **Customer Segmentation:** Analyzing customer demographics and purchase behavior to create targeted marketing strategies.
* **Profitability Analysis:** Incorporating cost data to analyze profit margins by product, category, or location.
* **Inventory Management:** Integrating inventory data to identify stock levels and optimize purchasing decisions.
* **Forecasting:** Implementing predictive models to forecast future sales trends.
* **User Role Level Security:** If deployed in a Power BI service, implementing security to control data access based on user roles.
